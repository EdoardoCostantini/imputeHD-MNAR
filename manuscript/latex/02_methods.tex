\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}

Estimation bias introduced by the missing data treatment was quantified as Percent Relative Bias (PBR):

\begin{equation}
	PBR = \frac{\bar{Q}^{k} - R^{k} }{R^{k}}*100 \label{eq:bias_p}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{Q}^{k}$ is the mean estimate of parameter $k$ across the Monte Carlo simulations, and $R^{k}$ is the 
reference value corresponding to that parameter. The reference ("true") values of the parameters of interest were 
obtained by averaging the 500 MLEs obtained on the fully observed datasets. 

Furthermore, the euclidean distance $d$ between vectors of raw parameter estimates of the same type of statistic 
($\bm{Q}^{K}$) and a reference $\bm{R}^{K}$ vector was considered to provide a more aggregate quantification of bias:

\begin{equation}
	d(\bm{R}^{K}, \: \bm{Q}^{K}) = 
		\sqrt{ 
			(R^{K}_{1} - Q^{K}_{1})^{2} + 
			(R^{K}_{2} - Q^{K}_{2})^{2} + 
			... + 
			(R^{K}_{T} - Q^{K}_{T})^{2}
		} 
			\label{eq:eu_dist}
\end{equation}

where $\bm{Q}^{K}$ and $\bm{R}^{K}$ are vectors of parameters estimates of statistic type $K$ (i.e., means, variances, covariances). 
In particular, $\bm{R}^{K}$ is the vector or reference values, and $\bm{Q}^{K}$ is a vector of Monte Carlo parameters estimates after 
missing data treatment, and $T$ is the number of variables with missing values.

Finally, to assess the integrity of hypothesis tests conducted under the various imputation approches, the 95\% confidence 
interval coverage rates were computed as:

\begin{equation}
	CI_{cov} = \frac{ \sum_{s=1}^{S} I(Q \in \hat{CI}_{s} ) }{S^{k}}*100 \label{eq:ci_cov}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Experiment 2: Interactions and the like}
Data for this experiment were generated in two steps. First, a matrix of predictors was generated as in experiment 1.
Then, a dependent variable y was generated using one predictor from each block. Depending on the condition, an 
interaction term was either included or not.

Missing data was imposed using a probit model to facilitate manipulation of the proportion of missing cases.
In all conditions, seven variables where targeted by missingness: y, three in block 1, and three in block 2. Four variables
where randomly selected from X to use as predictors in the probit model for each target variable. The same set of
coefficients where used ($-1, -1, .666, -.333$).

\subsection{Experiment 3: Latent data}
Bla bla this makes a lot of sense
