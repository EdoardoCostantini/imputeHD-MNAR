REPLICATION GUIDE

Follow this instructions if you want to replicate with ease the results reported:

1. Make sure that all the packages liste in the script "init_general.R" are installed on your system

2. Go through the script "init_exp1.R" to check that all simulation fixed factors (e.g. number of iterations, imputation methods to use and the like) and experimental factors
(Proportion of missing data and dimensionality of the dataset) are set to the desired values.

3. Open the simulation script that matches your operating system (simulation_win.R for windows system and simulation.R for Linux and macOS). Specify the number of cores to use in the parallelisation of the simulation

4. Once the simulation is terminated, open the results.R script and run it. Objects will be named as tables reported in the paper.
