# imputeHD-comp
Repository hosting project high-dimensional imputation comparison. 

## Summary
Missing data handling can be performed with principled missing data treatment such as Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). These established methods perform well with low dimensional datasets but high-dimensional scenarios still present challanges. Parametrizing the imputation model when p > n is no easy task. Even when the dataset itself is not high-dimensinal, trying to include all the incteractions and polynomial terms can result in a p>n problem. 
Many algorithms have been proposed to tackle the challanges of missing data in high-dimensional datasets. This projects aims at comparing some of the most popular.

## Notes
As for now, this repository contains simple notes on the direction of the project.
