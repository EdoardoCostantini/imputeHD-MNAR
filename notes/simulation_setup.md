# Simulation set up ideas

## Factorial Design
* fixed: MAR + MCAR; sample size; set of auxiliary and junk variables
* factors: % missing info; number of p p<<n, p \simeq n, p >> n; variable types?

## Evaluation criteria
* estimates bias
* CI coverage
* FMI (interpreted as the relative loss of efficacy)
* computational speed; complexity of specification 
* complexity of implementation will be good to include both based on your own experience during 
	the project and in general if we find a good comparison meter
