# Simulation set up ideas

## Overarching research question
To what extent do the MI imputation methods considered grant statistical validity of the secondary data
analysis when the data imputed is high-dimensional.

## Simulation studies
* 1) multivariate normal data with no structure - Baseline: how well do the methods "recover" information 
		on the covariance structure of a simple unrealistic scenario?
	* factors: % of missing information; 2) dimensionality (p<<n, p =~ n, p >> n)
* 2) (multivariate normal) data with latent structure - How do the method perform when missingness 
		is on items that measure latent constructs
	* fixed: % of missing information; dimensionality (p >> n);
	* factors: latent construct normality level (+/- deviation from normality: i'm thinking 
		opinions/positions about polarising themes in society); 2) dependency between the latent 
		constructs (+/-, e.g.  if all latent constructs are normally distributed then think of it
		maybe creating three tiers of correlation levels: low, medium high, where the correlation 
		coefficients maybe are randomly generated for pairs of constructs between 0 and .33, .33 
		and .66; .66 and 1)
* 3) measurement levels - How well do the methods behave with different measurement levels (nominal, ordinal, interval)
	* fixed: % of missing information;  dimensionality (p >> n); latent structure
	* factors: percentage of p that are measured with each level?
* 4) complex relationships - How well do the methods preserve non-linearity and interactions
	* fixed: % of missing information;  dimensionality (p >> n); latent structure?
	* factors: percentage of p that are categorical?
* 5) cross-sectional EVS dataset with clusters?

## Factorial Design
* fixed: MAR + MCAR; sample size; set of model-relevant, auxiliary and junk variables
* factors: 
	* % missing info; 
	* number of p p<<n, p =~ n, p >> n; 
	* weird variable distributions (binomials, poisons (e.g. number of children), skewed truncated
		normals (many 1-10 scales), cut-off (mmm something like age where no one younger than 
		18 is measured)
	* interaction types and quantity (based maybe on that paper that you read about MICE imputation 
		and interaction types) i.e. interaction types in theMAR mechanisms
	* linear/polynomial MAR

## Think about
* y model: there should be (at least) one variable that is generated according to some model involving 'true' predictors
	we might work with one linear model and maybe one GLM for categorical vairables. But this depends
	also on whether we want to include only continuous variables in the simulation study or other types 
	as well.
* Interactions in the true model: should we perform a couple of simulation studies, one without and one with 
	interactions (polynomials as well) in the true model? If so, should the types of interactions be 
	factors in the simulation study that includes them? (e.g. Doove et al 2014) I do not think so as our research
	question is not related specifically to how the different methods handle the presence of interactions.
	We are more focused on which method achieves greater statistical validity of the secondary analysis. 
	It could be interesting to simply insert a variety of interaction effects based on the results of Doove
	et al 2014: higher interaction effect size -> higher bias; higher correlation between interacting 
	variables -> better statistical performance of estiamtes; double ordinal interactions are most well
	preserved, perfect double disordinal are the hardests.
* Missingness on auxiliary variables: for now it seems reasonable to assume that missingness occurs in 
	the variables that are true predictors of some y, but not in the auxiliary and junk variables

## Evaluation criteria
* estimates bias
* CI coverage
* FMI (interpreted as the relative loss of efficacy)
* computational speed; complexity of specification


## Experiment 3
* Non-linear MAR: Collins et al 2001 found that including the variables responsible for nonlinear MAR 
	missingness was sufÔ¨Åcient to eliminate bias; that is, it was not necessary to include a 
	nonlinear transformation of the variable. Howard et al 2016 say that "it is theoretically possible 
	that including such nonlinear terms (e.g., squared auxiliary variables and interactions among 
	auxiliary variables) may account more fully for the missingness mechanism, though we do not know how 
	likely this is to occur in practice. In the present study, we include such interaction terms in the 
	set of auxiliary variables from which principal components are computed." In my study I have an 
	experimental factor that is presence of the interaction in the response model generating proabiblity
	of missingness to check just that: is it suffcient to include the variables responsible or do we need
	to keep into account the interaction of the non-linear mar
